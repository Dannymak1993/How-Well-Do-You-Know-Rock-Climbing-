# How Well Do You Know Rock Climbing?

## Description

What I have created is a rock climbing quiz that will test your knowledge of the sport. The reason I built this product is to to incorporate the concepts of buttons, loops, event listeners, objects and local storage. Mastery of these concepts will help with future projects of larger magnitude as well as incorporating of more complex concepts such as jquery. Aside from all the concepts listed above, I learned the use case of attaching an HTML within an HTML and having 2 scripts.cs to help keep things organized.

## Credits

I googled many concepts referring to eventlisteners, for loops, buttons, localstorage and objects. I also referred to many class activites for ideas on how to use these ideas statements.
